<h2>Education</h2>

<h3>Manipal Institute of Technology, Manipal KA, India</h3>
<p>
    Secured a Bachelor of Technology in Mechanical Engineering with Distinction
</p>
<p>
    Relevant courses: Mechanical Design, CAD, Finite Element Methods, Design for Manufacturing and Assembly (DFMA),

</p>
<p>
    Seminar: Design of self-balancing two-wheeler – Gyroscopic balancing working principle, shortcomings, and
    alternative methods to achieve the self-balancing.
</p>
<p>
    Course-mandated projects:
    <ol>
        <li>
            Design of a feeder assembly to feed one object at a time, using an electro-pneumatic setup.
            The mechanism used a combination of a double-acting cylinder and various flow-control valves (5/2 and
